## Quadane
This is the project of an open source **qua**litative **d**ata **an**alysis **e**nvironment. It is intended in the near future to be a software that supports qualitative and/or mixed research methods, meaning you could fully and consistently analyze and organize many sorts of data inside the same environment, with external integration possibilities (like Google Drive or Trello webhooks), in many media formats. For example, you could insert audio/video interviews, survey responses, articles, web content and social media posts, all of which would be about the same subject, with the purpose of collect data with consistency throughout all that media for further and more complete scientific analysis.

The usefulness of this project finds its place on giving researchers the ability to manage all kinds of source and raw material in order to expand insights about given data. In other words, *if you can see your data more efficiently*, you could essentially *make better questions* about your data as well.

As of this stage of the project, me and [@casql](https://github.com/casql) are searching for contributors for the initial design and coding.

If you want to keep it real, just branch us and/or open an issue.

Cheers!
